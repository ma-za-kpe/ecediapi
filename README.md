## Harnessing the Power of Blockchain to Empower African Farmers with a Transparent Carbon Credit System

**Carbon Ledger** offers a revolutionary approach to carbon credit systems, leveraging blockchain technology to provide African farmers with a secure, transparent, and economically beneficial method of documenting and verifying their carbon sequestration efforts.

### Solution Overview

Our solution enables farmers to accurately record their carbon capture activities using state-of-the-art satellite imagery and blockchain technology. By simply entering the GPS coordinates of their farm, our system analyzes carbon sequestration rates and generates a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) graph. This data, once processed, is converted into a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT) that serves as a secure and immutable record on the blockchain, facilitating trustworthy transactions in the carbon credit markets.

### Methodology

1. **User Authentication**: Farmers initiate the process by authenticating and logging into their Web3 wallets, ensuring secure and private access.
2. **Location Input**: Users enter the GPS coordinates of their farm to set the central point for the subsequent analysis.
3. **Satellite Imagery Retrieval**: Utilizing Google Earth Engine, the system gathers a decade's worth of satellite imagery for the specified location.
4. **Vegetation Density Analysis**: The software applies NDVI analysis to measure changes in vegetation density over time, indicating levels of carbon sequestration.
5. **Data Visualization**: Results from the NDVI analysis are transformed into a comprehensive time-series chart, showcasing the progression of vegetation growth and carbon capture.
6. **Blockchain Integration**: The metadata from the NDVI chart is encoded into a distinctive NFT, symbolizing the farm's carbon sequestration achievements.
7. **Secure Recording**: Finally, this NFT is securely recorded on the blockchain, providing a verifiable and immutable basis for carbon credit assessments.
